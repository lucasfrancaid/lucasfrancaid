As a Senior Software Developer I have helped companies to improve/create their products, save money/time and increase their revenue, delivering important things (sometimes in an unbelievable time) with high quality, helping them to be competitive.

I'm a creative person, dedicated, responsible and inovative. I'm intense, fast-learner, and problem solver.

I can build/fix things using Go/Golang (Gin, Gorm, Gocolly, Testify), Python (FastAPI, Flask, Django, Pytest, Pydantic, SqlAlchemy), Javascript (NodeJS, Express, ReactJS, VueJS, NextJS), Amazon Web Services (EC2, Lambda Functions, SQS, SNS, API Gateway, S3 Bucket, SES), SQL Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, RDS Aurora), NoSQL Databases (Redis, DynamoDB, Elasticsearch), Monitoring Tools (ELK, Dynatrace, Splunk, Open Telemetry), CI&CD Tools (Github Actions, GitLabCI, BitbucketCI), and writing Automated Tests (Unit and Integration). Always looking to apply the best practices of software development and Design Patterns.
