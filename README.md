As a Software Developer I can help your company, improve your product and save your money/time. I can do it because I did it before, I have saved another companies increasing their revenue, develivering important things (sometimes in an unbelievable time) with high quality that helped them to be better.

What I have that made me able to do it? First things first: my family, brain, dedication, problem solving, creative skills, commitment and a sauce of passion. Using what? Just a computer and some energetic drink haha, it is true. I can do it using Go Language, Python (FastAPI, Flask, Django and others), Javasript (NodeJS), Amazon Web Services (Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB, RDS Aurora, API Gateway, S3 Bucket, SES, ECS), SQL and NoSQL Databases, Monitoring Tools (ELK, Dynatrace, Splunk, Open Telemetry), CI&CD Tools (Pre-commit, Github Actions, GitLabCI, BitbucketCI), and always writing Unit and Integration Tests, looking to the best practices and Design Patterns.
