# Hello visitor, you are very welcome!

I am a Software Developer focused on the Back-end and DevOps stuff but I have a general knowledge of the SDLC. Over the years I have helped companies to improve and create their products, save money and time, increase their revenue and delivery important things (sometimes in an unbelievable time) with high quality and reliability, helping them to be competitive.
